### TIPS USED while doing this project

1. JSON WEB TOKEN & SECURITY
- Issues Access Token and Refresh Token

- Access token = short time to expire

- Refresh token = long time to expire

- Client stores access token in memory and NOT in local storage or cookies
  >    (If you can store tokens with javascript (in localstorage and cookies) a hacker can also retrieve it with javascript)

- The REST API with issues a `httpOnly cookie`
  > this cookie cannot be accessed with javascript

- Refresh token should have an expiration, which then require a user to login again

- Refresh tokens should not have the ability to issue new refresh tokens because that will grant indefinite access. - they should also be able to expire

- Acess token is issued after user authentication

- New token is issued at Refresh request

2. To generate random access and refresh tokens with node for our env access token
>>>> 
    open terminal
    type node, hit enter
    type require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')
